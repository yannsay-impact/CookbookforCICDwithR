[["index.html", "A Minimal Book Example Chapter 1 Prerequisites", " A Minimal Book Example Yihui Xie 2022-11-03 Chapter 1 Prerequisites This is a sample book written in Markdown. You can use anything that Pandocs Markdown supports, e.g., a math equation \\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\). The bookdown package can be installed from CRAN or Github: install.packages(&quot;bookdown&quot;) # or the development version # devtools::install_github(&quot;rstudio/bookdown&quot;) Remember each Rmd file contains one and only one chapter, and a chapter is defined by the first-level heading #. To compile this example to PDF, you need XeLaTeX. You are recommended to install TinyTeX (which includes XeLaTeX): https://yihui.org/tinytex/.

It is probably also a best practice to use renv. Try to deploy your app (either with the publish/redeploy button) or rsconnect::deployApp() While this step is not really necessary, it is to make sure your app runs once and any further problems do not come from the app itself. Add a description usethis::use_description(check_name = F). check_name = F to avoid checking name valid for CRAN. Add the shiny-deploy.yaml usethis::use_github_action(\"shiny-deploy.yaml\") Edit the shiny-deploy.yaml, especially the following part. You can either fill in for the APPNAME, ACCOUNT, SERVER. - name: Authorize and deploy app env: # Provide your app name, account name, and server to be deployed below APPNAME: your-app-name ACCOUNT: your-account-name SERVER: shinyapps.io # server to deploy run: | rsconnect::setAccountInfo(&quot;${{ secrets.RSCONNECT_USER }}&quot;, &quot;${{ secrets.RSCONNECT_TOKEN }}&quot;, &quot;${{ secrets.RSCONNECT_SECRET }}&quot;) rsconnect::deployApp(appName = &quot;${{ env.APPNAME }}&quot;, account = &quot;${{ env.ACCOUNT }}&quot;, server = &quot;${{ env.SERVER }}&quot;) shell: Rscript {0} Or you can remove the env block and change the rsconnect::deployApp call. - name: Authorize and deploy app run: | rsconnect::setAccountInfo(&quot;${{ secrets.RSCONNECT_USER }}&quot;, &quot;${{ secrets.RSCONNECT_TOKEN }}&quot;, &quot;${{ secrets.RSCONNECT_SECRET }}&quot;) rsconnect::deployApp() shell: Rscript {0} Specify the R version. I have a problem with the update of 4.2 from the 30.10.2022, so I have added a step to specify the same R version to be installed on the github action rather than the latest one. This should be a temporary measure while something better is figured out. From - uses: r-lib/actions/setup-r@v2 with: use-public-rspm: true To - uses: r-lib/actions/setup-r@v2 with: r-version: &#39;4.1.0&#39; use-public-rspm: true Add 3 secrets in the repository to store you account, token and secret (see prerequisite). They should have those names RSCONNECT_USER, RSCONNECT_TOKEN, and secret RSCONNECT_SECRET You can follow these guides if needed Link the shiny app folder to the github repo (add the remote and origin) Push!
