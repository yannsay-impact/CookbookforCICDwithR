# Test coverage

## test-coverage

Quick how-to to set a GitHub action to get code coverage and the badge from Codecov each time there is merge into the **main** (or **master**) branch using `r-lib` [test-coverage.yaml](https://github.com/r-lib/actions/blob/v2-branch/examples/test-coverage.yaml).

## Prerequisite

Have a [Codecov](https://app.codecov.io/) account link with your repository.

None in particular but could be good to have some [tests](https://r-pkgs.org/testing-basics.html) as to get a coverage of something.

## Steps

-   Create your package.

-   Link your local to the remote if it has not be done yet (make sure your project is linked to a Github repository).

-   Make sure Codecov has synced with your repository. The repository should appear in the *Not yet setup* if this is the first time. The syncing between GitHub and Codecov takes a bit of time so you can go for a coffee or lunch.![repo not yet setup](images/test-coverage/codecovnotyetsetup.png)

-   Try to test your package `covr::package_coverage()`.

    -   While this step is not really necessary, it is to make sure your tests runs once and any further problems do not come from the tests.

-   Add the test-coverage.yaml `usethis::use_github_action("test-coverage")`

-   Add the badge with `usethis::use_coverage("codecov")`

    -   This step should add a badge in your readme file. ![badge added](images/test-coverage/addbadge.png)
    -   Or should give you a message in the console telling you to copy and paste some lines in the README. ![badge added](images/test-coverage/copybadge.png)
    -   If nothing happen, you can add the line directly following the syntax or remove the **codecov.yml** from the project folder and run `usethis::use_coverage("codecov")` again.

-   Push!

-   The GitHub action will push the report to Codecov, you can see the report by clicking on the badge.

    -   **Github and Codecov needs to sync for the percentage to appear**
