# Style

## styler

Quick how-to to set a github action to style each time there is push or a pull request with files that includes *.[rR]*, *.[rR]md*, *.[rR]markdown*, *.[rR]nw*. into the **main** using `r-lib` [style.yaml](https://github.com/r-lib/actions/blob/v2-branch/examples/style.yaml).

## Prerequisite

None in particular.

## Steps

-   Create your package.

-   Try to test your package `styler::style_pkg()`

    -   While this step is not really necessary, it is to make sure your tests runs once and any further problems do not come from the tests.

-   Add the style.yaml `usethis::use_github_action("style")`

    -   You can change the styler::style_pkg to ```styler::style_file``` or ```styler::style_dir```.
    ```{yaml}
      - name: Style
        run: styler::style_pkg(filetype = c(".R", ".Rmd", ".Rmarkdown", ".Rnw"))
        shell: Rscript {0}
    ```

    -   More info and customisation on the [package page](https://styler.r-lib.org/articles/styler.html).  
-   Push!

## Possible errors
### Error 403 
It is possible that once you set your action, it will not run and you will get an error 403. Error
403 is usually link to a forbidden access error. It can look as below. It can happen if you changed ownership from a repository. 
```
remote: Permission to /ACCOUNT-NAME/REPO-NAME.git denied to github-actions[bot].
fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/ACCOUNT-NAME/REPO-NAME/': The requested URL returned error: 403
```

To remediate to this, you need to change the workflow permission in your repository settings:
-  Settings -> Action -> General -> Workflow permissions [stackoverflow topic](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/73687176/permission-denied-to-github-actionsbot-the-requested-url-returned-error-403)

### Protected branch
It is possible that the action fails if the branch is protected and needs review. Solution to be found. It may solves once the review is approved.

```
remote: error: GH006: Protected branch update failed for refs/heads/master.        
remote: error: At least 1 approving review is required by reviewers with write access. 
```
